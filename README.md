# Delivery Time Prediction Web Application

### Introduction:
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application for predicting delivery times based on various factors. The application allows users to input delivery details and receive an estimated delivery time. Additionally, users can explore the reasons behind the predictions based on statistical correlations and model insights.

### Working

- **User Input Form**: Collects data such as delivery person ID, age, ratings, weather conditions, road traffic density, vehicle condition, type of order, type of vehicle, multiple deliveries, festival occurrence, city, distance, and order time details.
- **Prediction Results**: Displays the predicted delivery time based on the input data.
- **Reasons for Prediction**: Provides detailed insights into the factors affecting the delivery time prediction.

### Technical Details

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Ensures the input data is clean and in the correct format.
- **Feature Engineering**: Constructs new features from the input data to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Hyperopt for optimizing model parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports model performance using metrics like RÂ² score, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.


## How to Use

You can use the Delivery Time Prediction Web Application in two ways: by running the code locally or by accessing it through a deployed link.

### 1. Running the Code Locally

1. **Install Requirements**: 
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
